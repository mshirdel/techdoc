Preparing for a senior-level interview is all about demonstrating not only technical expertise but also leadership, problem-solving skills, and deep understanding of architectural decisions. If I were the interviewer, here's a mix of technical and behavioral questions I might ask, tailored to Python, Django, and PostgreSQL:

---

### **1. Python-Specific Questions**
- **Core Concepts:**
  - How does Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) impact multi-threaded applications, and how can you work around it?
  - Explain the differences between mutable and immutable objects. Can you provide examples of both?
  - What are Python decorators, and how do you use them? Could you write a custom decorator?

- **Advanced Concepts:**
  - Can you discuss how Python handles memory management, including reference counting and garbage collection?
  - Describe the differences between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Python. How would you use `asyncio` in a web application?

- **Problem-Solving:**
  - Write a function to efficiently flatten a nested list of arbitrary depth.
  - How would you optimize a Python script that's running slower than expected?

---

### **2. Django-Specific Questions**
- **Core Framework Knowledge:**
  - Walk me through the lifecycle of a Django request and response.
  - Explain the difference between `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, and instance methods in Django views.
  - How do you handle forms in Django? Can you compare Django forms and REST serializers?

- **Advanced Topics:**
  - Describe how to implement custom middleware and when you'd need to use it.
  - How do you scale a Django application to handle high traffic? Can you explain caching strategies in Django?

- **Practical Problem:**
  - You're tasked with designing a Django application that requires role-based access control (RBAC). How would you approach this?
  - If your application started showing database performance issues, where would you look first, and how would you optimize it?

---

### **3. PostgreSQL-Specific Questions**
- **Core Database Knowledge:**
  - Explain the difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes. When would you use each?
  - How would you write a query to fetch the top 3 employees from each department based on their salaries?

- **Optimization and Debugging:**
  - How do you analyze and optimize slow queries in PostgreSQL? Can you explain the role of `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE`?
  - Describe a scenario where using a materialized view would be beneficial.

- **Data Modeling and Design:**
  - How would you design a database schema for a multi-tenant Django application?
  - Discuss the advantages and trade-offs of using JSON fields in PostgreSQL compared to traditional relational tables.

---

### **4. System Design and Architecture**
- How would you design an e-commerce application using Python, Django, and PostgreSQL to handle high availability and scalability?
- Can you discuss the trade-offs of using a monolithic vs. microservices architecture for a Django-based project?
- Walk me through your approach to implementing a full-text search feature in a Django application with PostgreSQL.

---

### **5. Behavioral and Leadership Questions**
- Tell me about a time you identified a performance bottleneck in an application and how you resolved it.
- Describe a challenging technical problem you faced in a project. How did you approach it, and what was the outcome?
- How do you mentor junior developers and ensure the team follows best practices?
- When faced with conflicting priorities in a project, how do you handle decision-making as a senior engineer?

---

### **6. Coding Challenge Example**
Write a Django view that allows a user to upload a CSV file and saves the data into a PostgreSQL database. Ensure the implementation includes error handling for invalid files and duplicate records.

Let me know if you'd like me to dive deeper into any of these areas or if you'd like to practice answering some of these questions!
