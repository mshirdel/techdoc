   - Explain how Django's ORM works. What are some advantages and disadvantages of using it?
   - How would you optimize a Django model for large datasets?

3. **Advanced Django**:
   - What are signals in Django? Can you provide an example of when you might use them?
   - Discuss Django's class-based views versus function-based views. What are the pros and cons of each?
   - How do you implement caching in a Django application?

### PostgreSQL Questions

1. **Database Design and Normalization**:
   - Explain the concept of normalization. What are the different normal forms, and why are they important?
   - How would you design a relational database schema for a blog application?

2. **Advanced SQL Queries**:
   - How do you write a query to retrieve the top N records from a PostgreSQL table?
   - Explain how you would perform a join in SQL. What types of joins are available?

3. **PostgreSQL Features**:
   - What are some unique features of PostgreSQL that distinguish it from other relational databases?
   - How do you handle database migrations in PostgreSQL?

### System Design Questions

1. **Architectural Patterns**:
   - Describe how you would design a scalable web application using Django and PostgreSQL. What considerations would you keep in mind?
   - How would you handle user authentication and authorization in a Django application?

2. **API Design**:

   - How do you approach code reviews? What do you focus on when reviewing someone else's code?

2. **Problem-Solving**:
   - Can you give an example of a time when you faced a significant technical challenge? How did you approach solving it?

### Practical Coding Questions

1. **Live Coding**:
   - Write a Django model for a simple e-commerce application with products and categories.
   - Given a list of integers, write a Python function that finds the two numbers that add up to a specific target sum.

2. **Algorithm Questions**:
   - How would you implement a function to check if a string is a palindrome?
   - Describe an efficient way to sort a large dataset and how you would handle it in Python.

### Preparation Tips
- **Hands-On Practice**: Work on coding problems on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank, focusing on Python.
- **Review Django Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the latest features and best practices.
- **Mock Interviews**: Practice with peers or use platforms that offer mock technical interviews.
- **Projects**: Be prepared to discuss your past projects in detail, focusing on your specific contributions and the technologies used.

By preparing responses to these questions, you’ll be well-equipped to demonstrate your knowledge and experience during your interview. Good luck!
