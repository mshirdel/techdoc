The CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO command in MySQL is used to configure or change the replication settings on a replica server. This command specifies the connection parameters that the replica uses to connect to the source (formerly known as the master) server. It replaces the older CHANGE MASTER TO command starting from MySQL 8.0.23 https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/change-replication-source-to.html.

Here are some key options you can set with this command:

•  https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=SOURCE_HOST: The hostname or IP address of the source server.

•  https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=SOURCE_USER: The username for the replication user.

•  https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=SOURCE_PASSWORD: The password for the replication user.

•  https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=SOURCE_LOG_FILE: The log file name from which to start replication.

•  https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=SOURCE_LOG_POS: The position in the log file to start replication from.

•  https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=SOURCE_PORT: The port number of the source server.

•  https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=SOURCE_SSL: Whether to use SSL for the connection.

For example, to set up a replica, you might use:

CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
SOURCE_HOST='source_host_name',
SOURCE_USER='replication_user_name',
SOURCE_PASSWORD='replication_password',
SOURCE_LOG_FILE='recorded_log_file_name',
SOURCE_LOG_POS=recorded_log_position;

This command helps ensure that the replica server can properly connect to and replicate data from the source server https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/replication-howto-slaveinit.html https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/configuring-outbound-replication-db-system-external-replica.html.

Is there a specific aspect of replication you're working on or need more details about?
