Certainly! Here's an advanced Python interview question that touches on several key concepts:

### Question:
**Implement a custom iterator class in Python that mimics the behavior of the built-in `range` function but also supports floating-point numbers. Include methods for iteration and the ability to check the length of the iterator.**

### Requirements:
1. The class should be named `FloatRange`.
2. It should accept three parameters: `start`, `stop`, and `step`, where `start` and `step` can be floating-point numbers.
3. Implement the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods to make the class iterable.
4. Include a method named `__len__()` that returns the number of steps in the range.

### Example Usage:
```python
fr = FloatRange(1.5, 5.5, 0.5)
for num in fr:
    print(num)

print(len(fr))  # Output: Number of steps in the range
```

### Solution:
```python
class FloatRange:
    def __init__(self, start, stop, step):
        self.start = start
        self.stop = stop
        self.step = step
        self._current = start

    def __iter__(self):
        self._current = self.start
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self._current >= self.stop:
            raise StopIteration
        current = self._current
        self._current += self.step
        return current

    def __len__(self):
        return max(0, int((self.stop - self.start) // self.step))

# Example usage
fr = FloatRange(1.5, 5.5, 0.5)
for num in fr:
    print(num)

print(len(fr))  # Output: 8
```

### Explanation:
- **`__init__()`**: Initializes the iterator with `start`, `stop`, and `step` values and sets the initial `_current` value.
- **`__iter__()`**: Resets the `_current` value to `start` and returns the iterator object itself.
- **`__next__()`**: Implements the logic for iteration. It raises a `StopIteration` exception when the end of the range is reached.
- **`__len__()`**: Calculates the number of steps in the range.

This question tests the candidate's understanding of iterators, custom class implementation, and handling floating-point arithmetic.

Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more advanced Python interview question that encompasses multiple concepts such as decorators, metaclasses, and context managers:

### Question:
**Design a system in Python that allows for timed execution of methods within classes. Specifically, create a metaclass that applies a decorator to all methods of a class, timing their execution and logging the duration. Also, ensure that this system can be used with a context manager to enable and disable timing dynamically.**

### Requirements:
1. **Metaclass**: Create a metaclass named `TimedMeta` that applies a timing decorator to all methods of a class.
2. **Decorator**: Implement a decorator that logs the execution time of a method.
3. **Context Manager**: Implement a context manager to enable and disable the timing dynamically.
4. **Example Usage**: Demonstrate the functionality with a sample class.

### Example Usage:
```python
class MyClass(metaclass=TimedMeta):
    def method1(self):
        # Simulate some work
        time.sleep(1)
        print("Method 1 executed.")

    def method2(self):
        # Simulate some work
        time.sleep(2)
        print("Method 2 executed.")

with TimingContextManager(enabled=True):
    obj = MyClass()
    obj.method1()
    obj.method2()

# Output should include the execution time of each method.
```

### Solution:

```python
import time
from functools import wraps

# Timing decorator
def timing_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Metaclass to apply the decorator
class TimedMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr, value in dct.items():
            if callable(value):
                dct[attr] = timing_decorator(value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Context manager to enable/disable timing
class TimingContextManager:
    def __init__(self, enabled=True):
        self.enabled = enabled

    def __enter__(self):
        global timing_decorator
        if not self.enabled:
            timing_decorator = lambda func: func

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        global timing_decorator
        # Reset timing_decorator to the original one after the context
        timing_decorator = self._original_timing_decorator

    # Save the original timing_decorator to reset later
    _original_timing_decorator = timing_decorator

# Example usage
class MyClass(metaclass=TimedMeta):
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(1)
        print("Method 1 executed.")

    def method2(self):
        time.sleep(2)
        print("Method 2 executed.")

with TimingContextManager(enabled=True):
    obj = MyClass()
    obj.method1()
    obj.method2()
```

### Explanation:
1. **`timing_decorator`**: A decorator function that measures and logs the execution time of a method.
2. **`TimedMeta`**: A metaclass that applies the `timing_decorator` to all methods of a class.
3. **`TimingContextManager`**: A context manager that enables and disables the timing dynamically by temporarily replacing the `timing_decorator`.

This question tests the candidate's understanding of metaclasses, decorators, and context managers, as well as their ability to combine these concepts to create a flexible and powerful system.
