RFCs, or **Request for Comments**, are a series of documents that describe standards, protocols, procedures, and guidelines related to the internet and other information technology systems. They are published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and sometimes by other associated organizations.

The purpose of an RFC is to present new ideas, concepts, methods, and protocols for consideration, critique, and eventual adoption or rejection by the internet community. If a proposal gains consensus, it may become a standard that defines how certain aspects of the internet operate.

Each RFC is assigned a unique number and is available publicly. For example, one of the most famous RFCs is RFC 791, which defines the Internet Protocol (IP).

There are several RFCs that have played a significant role in shaping the internet as we know it today. Here are a few notable ones:

### [[RFC 791 INTERNET PROTOCOL|RFC 791]] Internet Protocol (IP)
This RFC defines the Internet Protocol (IP), which is the fundamental protocol for routing traffic across the internet. It's a cornerstone of internet communication.

### RFC 792 - Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
ICMP is used for diagnostic and error-reporting purposes. Itâ€™s essential for tasks like the `ping` command, which checks the reachability of hosts on a network.

### RFC 854 - Telnet Protocol
This RFC defines the Telnet protocol, which allows for remote login and command execution over a network. Although it has largely been replaced by more secure protocols like SSH, Telnet was foundational in early networking.

### RFC 959 - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
This RFC defines the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which allows for the transfer of files between systems. FTP was one of the earliest protocols used for transferring data over the internet.

### RFC 2616 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1)
HTTP/1.1 is an important RFC as it defines the protocol used by web browsers to fetch web pages from servers. It's fundamental to how the World Wide Web functions.

### RFC 5246 - Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2
This RFC defines version 1.2 of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which is crucial for securing communications over the internet, such as in HTTPS.

### RFC 7230 to RFC 7235 - HTTP/1.1 Update
These RFCs provide updates and improvements to the HTTP/1.1 protocol, ensuring more efficient and secure web communication.

### RFC 8446 - Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3
This RFC defines version 1.3 of the TLS protocol, offering enhanced security and performance over its predecessors.

These RFCs are just the tip of the iceberg, and there are many more that have contributed to the development and evolution of the internet. If you're interested in a specific area or protocol, I can help you find more detailed information!
